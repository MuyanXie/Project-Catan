# Project Catan (Backend)

This project aims to promote an online room trading platform for the Catan Table games. Originally, within the game, the only trading mode is face-to-face instant trades. This platform tries to integrate more refined financial trading deals, such as Futures, Forwards, Swaps and Options, among the five resources: Lumber, Wool, Grain, Brick, Ore.

First of all, this documnet will domenstrate how the app functions and the main usage of the platform. Also, this document describes the REST API implementations within the backend using Java Spring Boot and H2 Database. Finally, a detailed unit testing and integration testing report will be attached. For Frontend using React.js, please turn to [Placeholder (frontend link)](placeholder)
