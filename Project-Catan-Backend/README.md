# Project Catan Backend

This is the RESTful API backend build by Java Spring Boot for the Project Catan. 

Please refer to the README.md in the root directory of this project for more information. Also, you can refer to the API Test Collection for an overview of the Postman unit tests this project uses.

To get a better a idea of how the backend works, please refer to the Controller Layers and Service Layers in the source code. This backend is built using three layer architecture: Controller Layer, Service Layer and Repository Layer. The Controller Layer is responsible for handling the REST API requests and responses. The Service Layer is responsible for handling the business logic and the Repository Layer is responsible for handling the database operations.
